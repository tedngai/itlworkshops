<h3>Project Description</h3>
The is the results of our first sound test. Our test is to investigate the acoustical performance of commercially available and common sense materials. Industry standards typically rates materials with a NRC (Noise Reduction Coefficient) value. However, since noise is not just a magnitude but also a spectrum, we wanted to develop materials that would perform best at specific frequencies.

<h4>Installations</h4>
<p>
First you want to to install <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/">Anaconda</a>, and the current version as of writing is Python 3.7.

<pre><code>i = 0;

while (!deck.isInOrder()) {
    print 'Iteration ' + i;
    deck.shuffle();
    i++;
}

print 'It took ' + i + ' iterations to sort the deck.';
