<h3>Project Description</h3>
This workshop is our first introduction to data visualization with Python.

<h3>Installations</h3>
<p>
First you want to to install <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/">Anaconda</a>, and the current version as of writing is Python 3.7.

Once you have downloaded and installed Anaconda, open a Terminal if you're on OSX or Anaconda Prompt if you're on Windows.

You want to create a <b>Virtual Environment</b> for this exercise. The purpose of virtual environment is to create an isolated environment to contain all the packages you will install. Since python is used from machine learning to webscraping to data visualization, sometimes you will encounter an application such as GIS will require python version 2.7 and tensorflow will only work with python version 3.5. So virtual environment is a very convenient way to manage your python installations.

To create a virtual environment in Anaconda, in the <b>Terminal</b> or <b>Anaconda Prompt</b>, type
<pre><code>conda create -n plotly python=3.6
</code></pre>

When asked to proceed, click <b>Y</b> and press <b>Enter</b>.

<h3>Results in the Low Frequencies (20Hz - 5000Hz)</h3>

<h3>Preformatted</h3>
<pre><code>i = 0;

while (!deck.isInOrder()) {
    print 'Iteration ' + i;
    deck.shuffle();
    i++;
}

print 'It took ' + i + ' iterations to sort the deck.';
</code></pre>
