<h2>Project Description</h2>
This workshop is our first introduction to data visualization with Python. No programming background is required. In this first workshop you will learn to setup Python programming environment and all the related programming packages, and you will end with a fairly straight forward webscraping exercise to visualize the income level of the University of Virginia School of Architecture Faculty. By the end of this session, you will learn to do something like this.

<h1>Step 1</h1>
<h3>Python Installation</h3>
<p>
First you want to to install <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/">Anaconda</a>, and the current version as of writing is Python 3.7.</p>

<p>Once you have downloaded and installed Anaconda, open a <b><a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/mac-software/how-use-terminal-on-mac-3608274/">Terminal</a></b> if you're on OSX or <b><a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/">Anaconda Prompt</a></b> if you're on Windows.</p>

<p>You want to create a <b>Virtual Environment</b> for this exercise. The purpose of virtual environment is to create an isolated environment to contain all the packages you will install. Since python is used from machine learning to webscraping to data visualization, sometimes you will encounter an application such as GIS will require python version 2.7 and tensorflow will only work with python version 3.5. So virtual environment is a very convenient way to manage your python installations.</p>

<p>To create a virtual environment in <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/">Anaconda</a>, in the <b><a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/mac-software/how-use-terminal-on-mac-3608274/">Terminal</a></b> or <b><a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/">Anaconda Prompt</a></b>, type:</p>
<pre><code>conda create -n dataviz python=3.6</code></pre>

![test image size](../../../assets/images/pic_anaconda_env.jpg){:height="50%" width="50%"}

<p>When asked to proceed, click <b>Y</b> and press <b>Enter</b>. If you have trouble creating an environment in Anaconda, please refer to this <a href="https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html">page</a> </p>

<p>Now that you have Python running in your system, you want to activate the environment you just created and then start installing all the packages that we will use to complete this workshop. First activate the environment by typing this in the <b>Terminal</b> or <b>Anaconda Prompt</b>.</p>

<pre><code>conda activate dataviz</code></pre>

<p>If you're successful in activating the virtual environment, you should see the name of the enviroment appear in brackets.</p>

<h1>Step 2</h1>
<h3>Jupyter Notebook Installation</h3>
<p>Next we need to install <a href="https://jupyter.org/index.html">Jupyter Notebook</a> by typing the following command in <b>Terminal</b> or <b>Anaconda Prompt</b>, and type <b>Y</b> when asked to Proceed.</p>

<pre><code>conda install jupyter</code></pre>

![test image size](../../../assets/images/pic_jupyter.jpg){:height="50%" width="50%"}

<p>Jupyte Notebook is an Interactive Computing Environment that allows your to get immediate feedback when coding, thereby making programming much more visual and intuitive.</p>

<h3>Installing Other Python Packages</h3>
<p>Next we install <a href="https://plot.ly/python/getting-started/">Plotly</a>, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/numpy/">Numpy</a>, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/">Beautifulsoup</a>, and <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html">Pandas</a> by typing the following command in <b>Terminal</b> or <b>Anaconda Prompt</b>.</p>

<pre><code>pip install plotly numpy beautifulsoup4 pandas</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://plot.ly/python/getting-started/">Plotly</a> is a dynamic graphing web application, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/numpy/">Numpy</a> is a processor that deal with multidimensional arrays or matrices, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/">Beautifulsoup</a> is a webscraping module, and <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html">Pandas</a> is a library for data processing.</p>

<h1>Step 3</h1>
<h3>Launch Jupyter Notebook</h3>
<p>Next, we first create a folder where all the coding files will reside. In my case I'll create a folder on my desktop call <b>dataviz</b>. You can do that however you want. Once the folder has been created, go back to your <b>Terminal</b> or <b>Anaconda Prompt</b>, then type <b>cd</b> and then the path to your newly created folder. *If you don't like typing the full path of your folder by hand, follow this tip.</p>

<ul class="actions">
	<li><a href="https://searchenterprisedesktop.techtarget.com/photostory/2240216625/Ten-hidden-Windows-command-prompt-tricks/11/Drag-and-drop-a-folder-to-open-command-prompt" target="_blank" class="button">Tip Windows</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://osxdaily.com/2009/11/23/copy-a-files-path-to-the-terminal-by-dragging-and-dropping/" target="_blank" class="button">Tip OSX</a></li>
</ul>

<pre><code>cd /Users/tedngai/Desktop/dataviz</code></pre>

![test image size](../../../assets/images/pic_desktopfolder.jpg){:height="50%" width="50%"}

<p>Once you're in your newly created folder, copy download these 2 data file and place them into your folder, and then you can launch Jupyter Notebook by typing the following. Your web browser should open the web app, and Jupyter should now show your current location. </p>

<ul class="actions">
	<li><a href="../../../assets/files/SalaryScrape.zip" class="button">Download Data File</a></li>
</ul>

<pre><code>jupyter notebook</code></pre>

![test image size](../../../assets/images/pic_jupyternotebook_launch.jpg){:height="50%" width="50%"}

<p>Last but not least, click the <b>New</b> button at the near top right and click on Python 3 to create a new notebook. And congratulations, if you are able to get to this point, you are all set to do some exciting programming. If you have trouble getting things to work thus far, please carefully review the steps and make sure you have your virtual environment activated and you are in a proper folder. If you continue to have problem, please feel free to contact us via Slack or email.</p>

<h1>Step 4</h1>
<h3>Webscraping</h3>
<p>Once you're in your newly created folder, you can launch Jupyter Notebook by typing the following, and your web browser should open the web app. Jupyter should now show you an empty folder which is your current location. Anything you create inside this web app will appear as a file in your regular folder. </p>
