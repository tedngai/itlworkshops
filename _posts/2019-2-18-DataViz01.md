<h3>Project Description</h3>
The is the results of our first sound test. Our test is to investigate the acoustical performance of commercially available and common sense materials. Industry standards typically rates materials with a NRC (Noise Reduction Coefficient) value. However, since noise is not just a magnitude but also a spectrum, we wanted to develop materials that would perform best at specific frequencies.

<h4>Methodology</h4>
<p>For the test we are using a calibrated microphone to record the sound pressure level (SPL) of a frequency sweep from 20Hz to 20kHz. Multiple control recordings are made without any interferrence between the speaker and the microphone. An extruded aluminum jig is used to lock the position of the speaker, the microphone, and sound proofing material.

The SPL is recorded with RoomEQ, and the data is processed in Python, and finally, visualization is done via Plotly.</p>
