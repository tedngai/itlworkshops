<h3>Installations</h3>
<p>
First you want to to install <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/">Anaconda</a>, and the current version as of writing is Python 3.7.</p>

<p>Once you have downloaded and installed Anaconda, open a <b>Terminal</b> if you're on OSX or <b>Anaconda Prompt</b> if you're on Windows.</p>

<p>You want to create a <b>Virtual Environment</b> for this exercise. The purpose of virtual environment is to create an isolated environment to contain all the packages you will install. Since python is used from machine learning to webscraping to data visualization, sometimes you will encounter an application such as GIS will require python version 2.7 and tensorflow will only work with python version 3.5. So virtual environment is a very convenient way to manage your python installations.</p>

<p>To create a virtual environment in <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/">Anaconda</a>, in the <b>Terminal</b> or <b>Anaconda Prompt</b>, type:</p>
<pre><code>conda create -n dataviz python=3.6
</code></pre>

<p>When asked to proceed, click <b>Y</b> and press <b>Enter</b>. If you have trouble creating an environment in Anaconda, please refer to this <a href="https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html">page</a> </p>

<p>Now that you have Python running in your system, you want to activate the environment you just created and then start installing all the packages that we will use to complete this workshop. First activate the environment by typing this in the <b>Terminal</b> or <b>Anaconda Prompt</b>.</p>

<pre><code>conda activate dataviz
</code></pre>

<p>Then install <a href="https://jupyter.org/index.html">Jupyter Notebook</a> by typing the following command in <b>Terminal</b> or <b>Anaconda Prompt</b>, and type <b>Y</b> when asked to Proceed.</p>

<pre><code>conda install jupyter
</code></pre>

    deck.shuffle();
    i++;

print 'It took ' + i + ' iterations to sort the deck.';
