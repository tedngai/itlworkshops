<h3>Project Description</h3>
The is the results of our first sound test. Our test is to investigate the acoustical performance of commercially available and common sense materials. Industry standards typically rates materials with a NRC (Noise Reduction Coefficient) value. However, since noise is not just a magnitude but also a spectrum, we wanted to develop materials that would perform best at specific frequencies.

<h3>Installations</h3>
<p>
First you want to to install <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/">Anaconda</a>, and the current version as of writing is Python 3.7.

Once you have downloaded and installed Anaconda, open a Terminal if you're on OSX or Anaconda Prompt if you're on Windows.

You want to create a <b>Virtual Environment</b> to contain all the packages you will install for this exercise.
